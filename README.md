# workout-tracker
Workout tracker using HTML tables, in progress

NEW DESIGN 02.27.24:
- focus on just one table for now, previously tried to do too much at once
- functions where you add row/table should be last as you need the entire
object to be implemented in order to create a new one

- [x] table date
- [x] table col names
- [x] 1 row that user can edit
- [x] delete row button. on every row since deleting specific row is common
- [x] swap row buttons. on every row to allow for swap to select the rows
- [x] add row button. only at foot since usually only used at start
- [x] tab navigation (already done from contentEditable)

- [ ] remove table
- [ ] add new table

- [ ] export to CSV
- [ ] append to CSV
- [ ] read CSV
